# Recommendations

Database: MongoDB (depending on your data model preference).
Authentication: JWT, OAuth, Passport.js.
Node.js with Express: For the server-side application.
Cloud Services: AWS or Azure for hosting, storage, and other services.
Docker/Kubernetes: For containerization and orchestration (optional but impressive).

Understand Each Component Deeply:

Node.js: Get comfortable with Node's asynchronous programming model and its event-driven architecture.
Express: Learn routing, middleware, request handling, and setting up RESTful APIs.
Mongoose: Deepen your understanding of schemas, models, and database interactions using MongoDB.
Passport: Master various strategies for authentication.
CORS: Understand cross-origin resource sharing and its security implications.
Focus on Best Practices:

Implement proper error handling.
